# Tuple. 
# To archive goals: 1. Both tuple and list can store any data type. 2. Both tuple and list can be accessed by index.
# Why Tuple is better than list: 1. Tuple consumes less memory. 
# 2. Elements in tuple have less lookup time, in this question values will be accessed and searched several times.
# 3. Data once entered into the tuple cannot be changed no matter what, in this question values won't be changed. 
# So tuple is a better option.
